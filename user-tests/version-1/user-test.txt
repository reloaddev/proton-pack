Acceptance Criteria

1. Each ghost entry must include when it was last seen, so the team can prioritize active cases. In other words, it
should be mandatory to state when a ghost was last seen when reporting it.

2. Determining a ghost’s spooky level has proven too dangerous. The legal department has requested that we stop
collecting and storing this information.

3. In the app’s frontend, when viewing a specific ghost, information about the human reporter should appear on the same
page. This requires a clear and consistent link between ghosts and their human reporters.

4. The Ghostbusters wiki now allows users to search for ghosts by name. This search should be fast, even as the
database grows.

5. The team’s storage bill has skyrocketed recently. The storage of ghost data should be optimized to use less space,
where possible.
